# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

## Green Belt

You qualified for a Green Belt 🥋🟢 and got a final grade of 4.87/6 for M2. Great job! You're building solid foundations.

| **Final Grade**                          | **4.87 out of 6**   |            |                                           |

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

Here are a few issues we were able to spot: by spamming the "create listing" button, I was able to create up to 4 instances of the same listing before being redirected to the main page. When looking at a booking it displays the total cost as the "hourly rate". When closing the app the user gets logged out each time. When doing some things and going back to the main page, we can navigate back with the android built in "go back" and do the flow back. Doing this we can arrive on corrupted listings screens.

On main there are some commented out tests. Try to clean this and avoid that for future Sprints. Also multiple places in the app you handle errors silently without providing feedback to the user as to what has gone wrong. This isn't good practice. Error will arise, you can't always avoid these (network errors for example) but the user needs to know what has gone wrong.

The repo is setup, but there are still issues with the CI. Ideally this problem should have been mentionned and fixed earlier

For this part, you received 5.06 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

You successfully implemented all functional requirements the course asks for.

The core functionalities are implemented, but a few things could be perfected. The maps feature feels a bit disconnected from the app right now. Also the authentication feature feels a bit weird, because it redirects to the login page after authenticating with google and entering personal informations.

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

Figma and Architecture Diagram aren't up to date. The Figma is quite close to the app but a few screens are outdated (my profile and tutor profile for example). The architecture diagram still lacks structure or clarity.

For this part, you received 3 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

The Spint Backlog prepared before the meeting was a bit minimal (one task per person). We added almost as many tasks during the meeting and these didn't have the necessary tags.

You have a good Product Backlog, but be sure to maintain it. User feedback should be taken into account in it and be sure to move user stories you completed into another column.


For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

The Team scrum documents were filled and clear.

The Scrum Master and Product Owner play their roles, but we are in a stage in which we expect them to provide more inputs during the meetings and the process. This may require a bit more preparation and work.

Because of this the meetings still have a tendency to be a bit unstructured from times to times because some issues arises and you start digressing.

We also interveen a bit too much during the meetings. It's not inherently bad that we talk during meetings. But for example about the remarks on the modularization of tests and the fact that the messaging task could be long to implement and should be splitted, we would like you to try spotting these and addressing them without our help.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

You improved on continuous delivery of value, but you still encounter big blockers that prevent the app from progressing consistently.

For example lately there were lots of fixes to do and issues with the tests and the CI so there werent as many feature implemented in the later sprints.

It's an issue that such issue arise as late. It's normal to have issues pop up, but ideally you should be able to identify and address them earlier so they don't cause this much trouble.

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 4.87/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
