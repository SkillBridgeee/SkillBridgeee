This file describes how to use fake repositories.

All fake repositories implement a fake interface that implements the real interface of
the correct repository (e.g interface FakeProfileRepo : ProfileRepository).

This allows us to define helper methods to test what each repository contains and call them
in the tests.
(e.g in the fake listing repo: getLastListingCreated to check whether a listing has been added).

There are three types of repositories:
- ‘error’
- ‘empty’
- ‘working’

- Error Repository :
Returns an error for each request.
This repository is used to test the UI when there is an error with the repositories.

- Empty Repository :
Has no data during initialisation.
This repository is used to test the UI when there is no data yet in a repository.
The only initial date is the current user (userID -> creator_1)

- Working Repository :
Has data during initialisation.
Here's the scenario for the working repository

There is two Profile Alice and Bob

The current User is Alice

Alice has made a proposal for Maths class
Bob has made a request for Physics class

Alice has book Bob request
Bob has book Alice proposal
